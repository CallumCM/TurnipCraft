### What I want for this modpack:
- I want you to go "Wow!" when you discover one of the countless handy little features
- I want you to be rewarded for creativity, *Cuisine* and *Tinkers Construct* do that nicely
- I want to encourage exploration and that is done perfectly with *Cubic Chunks* yes you heard me right, and some biome mods like Oh the Biomes You'll Go
